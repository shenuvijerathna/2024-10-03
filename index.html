            Touring the idyllic town of Ella would be incomplete if one misses out on experiencing the wonder of Ravana
            Falls. Renowned for being one of Sri Lankaâ€™s widest waterfalls, this 82 ft. the cascading body of water is
            nestled within the Ravana Ella Wildlife Sanctuary and a further six km from the Ella Railway Station. While
            providing outstanding opportunities for a leisurely swim, adventure seekers will also find that climbing
            some of the rocks located nearby affords awe-inspiring vistas of both the falls as well as some of Ellaâ€™s
            treasured surroundings.
